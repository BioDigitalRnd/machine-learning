Parkingson's Disease = Use of Learning models
* neural networks (n = 76 from 62 studies
* ensemble learning (n = 82 from 57 studies)
* nearest neighbor and variants (n = 33 from 33 studies)
* regression (n = 31 from 31 studies)
* decision tree (n = 28 from 27 studies)
* naïve Bayes (n = 26, from 26 studies)

-  One study showed that ML could be helpful to assess flares using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of RA patients. EMR data typically are larger in size than data collected in clinical studies but are of lower quality, which may have hampered model training in this project.
