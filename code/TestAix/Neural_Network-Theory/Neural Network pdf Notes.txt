Dense layers: (most common layers) [page 10]
- consist of interconnected neurons
* In a dense layer, each neuron of a given layer is connected to every neuron of the next layer
- each connection has a weight associated to it which is a trainable factor of how much of this input to use (weight * input)
- once the inputs-weights flow into our neuron, they are summed and a bias is added
* purpose  of this bias is to offset the output positively or negatively
{ y = mx + c }

Step Function: 
- mimic a neuron firing/not in the brain.
if sum(inputs*weights) + bias is > 0 neuron fires
else neuron doesn't fire


^ Goal of all neural networks is to generalize, meaning the network can see many examples of never-before-seen data and accurately output the values we hope to achieve

Neural Networks take in many samples at a time for two reasons:

* faster to train in btaches in parallel processing
* batches help with generalization during training
