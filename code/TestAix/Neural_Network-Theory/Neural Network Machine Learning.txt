Components of a neural network:
input layer
Hidden layer - computation/calculation
Output layer
Weights and Bias
Activation function
Loss Function

Layers:
Are used to hold the neurons(input point) and pass it onto the subsequent layers

Activation Function: 
Computers the output from the weighted sum of the inputs 

Uses sigma function as it ends with a result being 0 and 1
Output would be calculated using the Activation function

Feedforward and Backpropagation:
Feedforward - getting the initial output is the feedforward process in a neural network
Backpropagation - is used to update the weights in order to minimize the calculated error

Calculate the error -> Use gradient descent Algo -> Update weights -> Update Bias -> Do this for n number of iterations for accuracy 

Training a neural network:
We can implement a neural network in Python using NumPy
