Matrix column entries (attributes):
name - ASCII subject name and recording number
MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Jitter(%),MDVP:Jitter(Abs),MDVP:RAP,MDVP:PPQ,Jitter:DDP - Several
measures of variation in fundamental frequency
MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy
RPDE,D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation


MCC - range from -1 - 1 showing if the classifier had alot of false positives or negatives; closer to 1 means they had little false positives
Kappa - 
F1 - a kind of mean of precision and recall which punishes lower scores( if there is a bigger range between the precision/recall)
